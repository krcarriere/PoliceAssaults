1 'In combination' means in combination with one or more other races.  The sum of the five race groups adds to more than the total population because individuals may report more than one race.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note: The April 1, 2000 Population Estimates base reflects changes to the Census 2000 population from the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions.  Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race.  Hispanics may be of any race.  Abbreviations: Black = Black or African American; AIAN = American Indian and Alaska Native; NHPI = Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander.  The original race data from Census 2000 are modified to eliminate the ""Some Other Race"" category.
